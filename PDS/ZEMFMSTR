*  ADDEXIT(exitname                                                   *
*   Specifies the SMF exit member name.                               *
*   The name must match a supported SMF exit name.                    *
*                                                                     *

*  STATE=INACTIVE                                                     *
*   Specifies the initial exit state.                                 *
*   An active exit allows ZEMF to receive control from the Dynamic    *
*   Exits Facility when the SMF exit is invoked.                      *
*   An inactive exit is not invoked by the Dynamic Exits Facility.    *
*   If not specified, the default is STATE=INACTIVE.                  *
*                                                                     *
*   You can change the exit state dynamically by invoking the ZEMF    *
*   subsystem server EXIT command.                                    *
*                                                                     *

*   Specifies the order in which the system calls the ZEMF exit       *
*   associated with the SMF exit.                                     *
*   If not specified, the default is POS=FIRST.                       *

*   POS=SYSTEM specifies that the exit is called in any order.        *
*                                                                     *
*   POS=FIRST specifies that the exit is called before other exits    *

*   Specifies the exit system scope.                                  *
*   When SYS=NO is specified, the exit is not invoked system-wide.    *
*   When SYS=YES is specified, the system invokes the exit for work   *
*   running under the SMF-defined subsystems, such as JES2, JES3,     *
*   STC, TSO, ASCH or OMVS.                                           *
*                                                                     *
*  SUBSYS={STC|TSO|JES2|JES3|ASCH|OMVS}                               *
*   Specifies the exit subsystem scope.                               *
*   When SUBSYS is specified, the system invokes the exit only for    *
*   work running under the specified subsystems, such as JES2, JES3,  *
*   STC, TSO, ASCH or OMVS. If SUBSYS in not specified, SYS=YES must  *
*   be specified.                                                     *

*  To define SMF exits to the dynamic Exits Facility, you must        *
*  specify the exits in both PROGxx and SMFPRMxx PARMLIB members.     *
*  The system does not call the exits if they are defined in PROGxx   *
*  only.                                                              *

*  If you do not specify the SMF exit in the ADDEXIT keyword, the     *
*  system defaults to using the MVS supplied exit routine or your     *
*  installation supplied exit routine.                                *
